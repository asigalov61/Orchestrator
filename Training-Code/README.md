## NOTES ON MODEL SETTINGS

### 1) 4096 seq_len @ 512 local window attention size seem to be optimal for music
### 2) 24 layers @ 1024 model dimension seems to be the optimum for model size/speed and resulting loss/accuracy
### 3) Training @ 4 batches with gradient accummulation every 4 steps seems to be optimal
